#  CloudWatch Synthetics Canaries

CloudWatch Synthetics includes several built-in classes and functions that you can call when writing Node.js scripts to use as canaries.
Some apply to both UI and API canaries. Others apply to UI canaries only. A UI canary is a canary that uses the getPage() function and uses Puppeteer as a web driver to navigate and interact with webpages.
